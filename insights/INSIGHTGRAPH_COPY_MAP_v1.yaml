    executive_summary:
      title: "Executive Summary"
      template: |
        This network is large, well-funded, and highly connected on paper.

        When examined structurally, coordination capacity is constrained by thin co-investment, isolated governance, and a small number of actors carrying disproportionate bridging responsibility.

        The opportunity is not to increase scale, but to strengthen a small number of structural pathways that enable alignment, learning, and shared action.

    scale_snapshot:
      title: "Scale Snapshot"
      template: |
        The network includes ${nodes_total} total entities (${org_nodes} organizations and ${people_nodes} individuals) connected by ${edges_total} relationships.

        Total mapped funding volume: ${funding_total}.

        Scale provides context — it does not, by itself, indicate coordination.

    health_interpretation:
      title: "Network Health"
      template: |
        Network Health: ${health_score}/100 (${health_label}).

        Network Health reflects coordination capacity — not impact, effectiveness, or intent.

        ${health_description}

    coordination_findings:
      title: "Coordination Findings"
      template: |
        Coordination is shaped by overlap: co-investment pathways and shared portfolios.

        Co-investment rate: ${cofund_rate}% of grantees receive funding from more than one network funder.
        This suggests a thin coordination layer, where shared action is unlikely to emerge by accident.

        Natural starting points for alignment include overlap clusters where multiple funders already converge.

    governance_findings:
      title: "Governance Findings"
      template: |
        Governance ties indicate embedded connective tissue.
        Multi-board individuals detected: ${multiboard_count}.

        When governance overlap is low, coordination must be intentional and typically requires dedicated facilitation.

    brokers_and_roles:
      title: "Brokers & Structural Roles"
      template: |
        Structural roles translate network position into functional influence.

        Gatekeepers are highly visible access points between communities.
        Hidden brokers are structurally critical connectors with high betweenness and low visibility — quiet nodes that carry disproportionate coordination load.

        Identifying and supporting these roles can reduce bottlenecks and increase coordination capacity.

    risk_and_fragility:
      title: "Risk & Fragility"
      template: |
        The network contains ${single_point_bridge_count} single-point bridges whose removal would disconnect parts of the ecosystem.

        This highlights structural vulnerability: coordination depends on a small number of bridges.
        One potential structural intervention is to build redundant pathways through additional connectors and shared investment routes.

    structural_options:
      title: "Structural Options"
      template: |
        These are structural options — not prescriptions.

        • This suggests an opportunity to thicken co-investment pathways by starting with existing overlap clusters.
        • One potential structural intervention is to create intentional governance connective tissue where none exists.
        • The network may benefit from engaging key brokers (including hidden brokers) as practical conduits for cross-community alignment.
