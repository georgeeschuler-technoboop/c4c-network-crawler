## 🟡 Network Health: 55/100 (Mixed signals)

**Multi-Funder Grantees:** 2.7%
> Weak signal — only 2.7% have multiple funders, funders rarely co-invest

**Connected through Shared Funding:** 99%
> Nearly all organizations (99%) can reach each other through funding chains — a highly unified network

**Top 5 Funder Share:** 90.0%
> High — top 5 control 90.0%, limited funder diversity

### ✅ Positive Factors

- 🟢 **Highly connected** — 99% of organizations linked through shared funding

### ⚠️ Risk Factors

- 🔴 **Low coordination** — only 2.7% have multiple funders

## Funding Concentration
*Use Case: Funding Concentration*

🟠 **High concentration**

The top 5 funders account for **90.0%** of total funding. While some concentration is normal, this level suggests limited funder diversity. Smaller funders may struggle to influence field direction.

💡 **Implication:** Encourage mid-tier funders to coordinate for collective impact.

## Funder Overlap Clusters
*Use Case: Funder Flow*

🟡 **Limited overlap**

**118 grantees** (2.7%) receive from 2+ funders. Some natural alignment exists, but most grantees depend on a single funder. These shared grantees represent organic coordination points.

### 1. Alliance for the Great Lakes

**Alliance for the Great Lakes** receives from 5 network funders ($1,800,000 from The Joyce Foundation, CHARLES STEWART MOTT FOUNDATION, The Brookby Foundation + 2 more). This exceptional overlap signals strong funder consensus around their work — a natural coordination hub.

💡 **Opportunity:** Convene their funders for joint impact measurement, aligned reporting, or a co-funding conversation. This grantee could anchor a funder learning community.

### 2. St Jude Children's Research Hospital

**St Jude Children's Research Hospital** receives from 4 network funders ($67,934 from CHARLES STEWART MOTT FOUNDATION, COMMUNITY FOUNDATION FOR GREATER BUFFALO, ROCHESTER AREA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION + 1 more). This exceptional overlap signals strong funder consensus around their work — a natural coordination hub.

💡 **Opportunity:** Convene their funders for joint impact measurement, aligned reporting, or a co-funding conversation. This grantee could anchor a funder learning community.

### 3. American Rivers Inc

**American Rivers Inc** receives from 3 funders ($1,161,823 from CHARLES STEWART MOTT FOUNDATION, NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE FOUNDATION, THE SEARS SWETLAND FAMILY FOUNDATION). This overlap suggests shared priorities and potential for deeper alignment.

💡 **Opportunity:** Explore joint site visits, shared evaluation, or coordinated grant timing among these funders.

### 4. CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY

**CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY** receives from 3 funders ($76,376 from COMMUNITY FOUNDATION FOR GREATER BUFFALO, ROCHESTER AREA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION, COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF LORAIN COUNTY). This overlap suggests shared priorities and potential for deeper alignment.

## Portfolio Twins
*Use Case: Funding Concentration*

⚪ **Weak alignment**

Some portfolio overlap exists, but even the closest funder pairs share few grantees.

💡 **Opportunity:** Funder pairs with high overlap could pilot joint reporting, co-investment, or aligned grantmaking.

These funders share 26 grantees — natural partners for coordination.

These funders share 15 grantees — natural partners for coordination.

These funders share 13 grantees — natural partners for coordination.

These funders share 12 grantees — natural partners for coordination.

These funders share 11 grantees — natural partners for coordination.

## Shared Board Conduits
*Use Case: Board Network & Conduits*

⚪ **No multi-board individuals detected**

No one serves on multiple boards in this network. Governance structures are fully separate — a potential gap for coordination.

---

## Foundations with No Board Interlocks
*Use Case: Board Network & Conduits*

🔴 **Governance silos**

**16 of 16 funders** (100%) have no shared board members with other network foundations. This limits informal coordination channels and peer learning.

💡 **Opportunity:** Consider introductions between isolated funders with aligned portfolios.

### 1. NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE FOUNDATION

Distributes $432,363,158 with no governance ties to other network funders.

### 2. CHARLES STEWART MOTT FOUNDATION

Distributes $191,269,018 with no governance ties to other network funders.

### 3. The Joyce Foundation

Distributes $76,092,150 with no governance ties to other network funders.

### 4. THE FRED A & BARBARA M ERB FAMILY

Distributes $31,030,197 with no governance ties to other network funders.

### 5. COMMUNITY FOUNDATION FOR GREATER BUFFALO

Distributes $28,940,011 with no governance ties to other network funders.

## Hidden Brokers
*Use Case: Brokerage Roles*

🔍 **4217 hidden brokers identified**

**4217 organizations** have high betweenness centrality but low visibility — they quietly bridge otherwise disconnected parts of the network. These 'hidden brokers' often go unrecognized but play critical structural roles in enabling coordination.

### 1. FUND FOR LAKE MICHIGAN INC

**FUND FOR LAKE MICHIGAN INC** is both a capital hub ($1,100,000 distributed) and a hidden broker — they quietly shape funding flows while bridging otherwise disconnected parts of the network. They have no board interlocks with other network members — operating in governance isolation.

💡 **Suggested Focus:** Engage them in cross-funder coordination — they bridge groups that don't otherwise connect. Their structural position makes them valuable for pilot initiatives or coalition-building. As a major funder with no governance ties, consider facilitating introductions to peer funders for alignment conversations or joint learning.

### 2. MCDOUGAL FAMILY FOUNDATION

**MCDOUGAL FAMILY FOUNDATION** is both a capital hub ($3,669,000 distributed) and a hidden broker — they quietly shape funding flows while bridging otherwise disconnected parts of the network. They have no board interlocks with other network members — operating in governance isolation.

## Strategic Recommendations
*Use Case: Strategic Recommendations*

### 🧭 How to Read This

The network shows **mixed signals**. Some coordination exists, but structural gaps limit how effectively funders can align. Targeted interventions could unlock significant value.

### 🔗 Strengthen Funder Coordination

- **Nurture natural alignment:** A small number of shared grantees exist. Use these as anchors — convene funders around specific grantees to build relationships and explore joint action.

### 🏛️ Strengthen Governance Ties

- **Address governance silos:** Most funders have no shared board members. Consider facilitating cross-foundation board dialogues or joint trustee convenings to build informal relationships.

- **Identify potential bridge-builders:** No one currently serves on multiple boards. Look for respected individuals who could be nominated to additional boards to create connective tissue.

### 🌉 Work with Network Brokers

- **Engage hidden brokers:** 4217 organization(s) quietly bridge disconnected parts of the network. Involve them in coordination design — they see patterns others miss.
