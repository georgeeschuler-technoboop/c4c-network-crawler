# Visual Synthesis Guide
## InsightGraph Network Reports & Infographics

This guide defines how InsightGraph outputs should be translated into
infographics, presentations, and narrative summaries using external tools
(e.g., NotebookLM, slide generators, design tools).

The goal is **clarity without prescription**.

InsightGraph reveals structural patterns.
It does not recommend actions.

---

## Core Principle

> **Describe the network so decision-makers can decide.**

Do **not**:
- prescribe actions
- imply failure
- frame findings as deficiencies
- assume coordination is inherently desirable

Do:
- surface tradeoffs
- explain structural implications
- name what choices the structure enables or constrains

---

## Required Framing Language

Every synthesis artifact MUST include:

- A statement that patterns **do not imply failure**
- A statement that **multiple responses are valid**
- A statement that **no action is a valid choice**

Example:
> “This pattern does not imply failure. It reflects a common network structure with specific tradeoffs. Stakeholders may decide whether intervention is warranted based on their goals.”

---

## Decision Lens Pattern (Required)

All sections should follow this structure:

### What we observe
Plain-language description of the structural pattern.

### What this structure enables
How information, funding, or influence tends to flow.

### What this structure constrains
What is harder, slower, or more fragile as a result.

### How teams often use this insight
Neutral examples of how decision-makers might use the pattern to evaluate options.

⚠️ Never say what teams *should* do.

## Language Rules

### Allowed verbs
- reveals
- reflects
- enables
- constrains
- is consistent with
- is associated with
- teams often use this to decide whether…

### Disallowed verbs
- suggests
- recommends
- indicates a need for
- opportunity to
- should
- must
- fix / solve / address

## Portfolio Twins (Special Handling)

When two or more organizations show highly similar funding patterns:

- Do NOT label as redundancy or inefficiency
- Frame as **parallel exposure**
- Emphasize risk diversification vs coordination tradeoff

Required phrasing:
> “Portfolio similarity may reflect shared priorities rather than duplication. Stakeholders often examine this pattern to decide whether coordination would add value.”

---

## Visual Design Guidance

- Prefer **structure metaphors** over directional arrows
- Avoid checklists or roadmaps
- Use comparative visuals (before/after, clustered vs bridged)
- Use soft qualifiers (“often”, “tends to”, “may”)

---

## Closing Disclaimer (Required)

Every infographic or slide deck must end with:

> “InsightGraph surfaces structural patterns to support decision-making. It does not recommend actions or evaluate performance. No action is a valid outcome.”
