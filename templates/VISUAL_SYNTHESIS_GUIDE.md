# Visual Synthesis Guide

**Purpose:** Guidance for creating non-prescriptive visual summaries of InsightGraph reports.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Signals, Not Recommendations
Visual summaries should present **structural signals**, not implied actions.

❌ **Avoid:** "You should coordinate with these funders"  
✅ **Use:** "Teams often use this signal to decide whether coordination would add value"

### 2. Preserve Signal Intensity
Every visualization should indicate the signal intensity level:

| Level | Visual Treatment | Meaning |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Low** | Gray / muted | Primarily confirmatory / contextual |
| **Moderate** | Standard / neutral | Worth discussion or light exploration |
| **High** | Highlighted / emphasized | Merits active follow-up |

### 3. Normalize Inaction
Every visual should implicitly or explicitly acknowledge that **no action may be the appropriate outcome**.

## Visual Element Guidelines

### Network Diagrams
- Show structure, not implied relationships
- Label nodes with roles, not recommendations
- Use color for signal intensity, not importance ranking
- Include legend explaining what connections mean (and don't mean)

### Bar Charts / Rankings
- Frame as "distribution" not "priority"
- Avoid language like "top funders to contact"
- Use: "Funders by portfolio size" not "Key funders"

### Summary Cards
- Lead with "What this shows" not "What to do"
- Include guardrail text: "This does not imply..."
- Reference signal intensity in header

### Infographics
- Use descriptive headers: "Network Structure" not "Action Items"
- Include Decision Lens framing for each insight
- Add footer: "These signals support judgment; they are not recommendations"

## Language Patterns

### Allowed Phrasing
- "This signal is commonly used to assess whether..."
- "Teams often use this to decide..."
- "This pattern may warrant discussion"
- "Worth exploring if coordination is a goal"

### Disallowed Phrasing
- "You should..."
- "We recommend..."
- "This suggests you need to..."
- "Natural partners" (without qualification)
- "Opportunity to..." (implies action)
