# Synthesis Checklist

**Purpose:** Quick validation checklist for reviewing AI-generated or human-created summaries of InsightGraph reports.

---

## Pre-Publication Review

Use this checklist before sharing any synthesized content (slides, infographics, summaries, facilitation guides).

### Language Compliance

- [ ] **No prescriptive words:** "should", "must", "recommend", "best practice"
- [ ] **No implied recommendations:** "this suggests [action]", "this points to [action]"
- [ ] **No opportunity framing:** "opportunity to...", "this reveals an opportunity"
- [ ] **No semantic inflation:** "natural partners", "natural hub", "strong consensus"

### Signal Integrity

- [ ] **Signal intensity preserved:** Low / Moderate / High labels visible
- [ ] **Source attribution:** References InsightGraph report and date
- [ ] **Guardrails included:** "What this does NOT mean" present for high-interpretation sections

### Epistemic Discipline

- [ ] **Inaction normalized:** "No coordination needed" acknowledged as valid outcome
- [ ] **Usage framing:** "Teams often use this to decide..." (not "you should")
- [ ] **Structural vs. performance:** Clear that signals show structure, not effectiveness

### Portfolio Twins Specific

- [ ] **Low overlap = healthy:** Not framed as a problem
- [ ] **Primary use stated:** "Decide where coordination is NOT needed"
- [ ] **No coordination necessity implied:** Shared grantees ≠ required alignment
