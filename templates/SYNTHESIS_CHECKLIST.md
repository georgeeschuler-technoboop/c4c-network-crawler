# Synthesis QA Checklist

Use this before sharing any infographic, slide deck, or narrative summary.

## Language
- [ ] No “suggests”, “opportunity”, “should”, or “recommend”
- [ ] Uses “reveals / reflects / enables / constrains”
- [ ] Includes “teams often use this to decide whether…”

## Framing
- [ ] Explicitly states pattern does NOT imply failure
- [ ] Explicitly states multiple responses are valid
- [ ] Explicitly states no action is valid

## Decision Lens
- [ ] What we observe
- [ ] What this structure enables
- [ ] What this structure constrains
- [ ] How teams often use this insight

## Portfolio Twins
- [ ] Framed as parallel exposure, not redundancy
- [ ] No efficiency or duplication language

## Visual Tone
- [ ] No roadmaps or step lists
- [ ] No arrows implying directionality or progress
- [ ] Comparative or descriptive visuals used instead

## Final Check
- [ ] Would a reader feel informed, not instructed?
